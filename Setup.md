# Prerequisites

## Arduini IDE
Posledni Arduino IDE funguje v pohode. Import desky 3.strany take. Pridani desky pres JSON. 


Get the latest Arduino IDE software from arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

## ESP32 support

File -> Preferences  (or Arduino -> Preferences on MacOS)

go to "Additional Board Manager URLs"

Add *hc* and press oK


Tool -> Boad -> Boards Manager

search for "esp32"

Install "esp32 by Espressif Systems"

## ESP32 Flash Filesystem Upload support

Get the zip file of the latest release from 
https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/

Unzip the content to the tools folder of your Arduino IDE (~/Documents/Arduino/tools on MacOS,
similar on other OS) and restart IDE

## Additional libraries

Select Tools -> Library Manager

Install "U8g2"
Install "MicroNMEA"

## Additional libraries, part 2

From https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer select "Download ZIP", extract to the libraries
folder of your Arduino IDE (~/Documents/Arduino/libraries on MacOS), rename main folder to ESPAsyncWebServer
(remove the "-master")

From https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP select "Download ZIP", extract to the libraries folder
of your Arduino IDE, and rename main folder to AsyncTCP

## Additional libraries, part 3

Copy the libraries/SX1278FSK and libraries/SondeLib folder of this project to your Arduino IDE's libraries
folders, or, alternatively, create symbolic links (MacOS/Linux):

cd ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
ln -s <whereyouclonedthegit>/rdz_ttgo_sonde/libraries/SondeLib/ .
ln -s <whereyouclonedthegit>/rdz_ttgo_sonde/libraries/SX1278FSK/ .

Restart the Arduino IDE

(symbolic links are the preferred way, otherwise you have to copy the the libraries again after
each update)

## Final steps

In the IDE Tools -> Board: ->
Select "TTGO LoRa32-OLED v1"

Compile and Upload code

Upload data to SPIFFS with Tools -> ESP32 Sketch Data Upload
